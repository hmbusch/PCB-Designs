======================================================================

From time to time I sit down and design some circuitry that can be
used for multiple purposes, a component if you will. The designs for
these PCBs are stored in this project (or at least those I feel 
confident to share).

ChainableScrew595
-----------------

This design features a small PCB with an 74HC595 shift register
at it's heart. Multiple modules of these can be connected together
to form a shift register cascade. The register connects to an
ULN2803A Darlington Array sink driver whose outputs are available
as a 9 port screw header (8 ports + VCC connector).
As should be obvious from the design, this module can only be used
for sink switching, as it requires fewer and more common parts than
a similar design for source switching.

EAGLE-Libraries
---------------

Contains libraries for use with Cadsoft Eagle. These libraries 
contain parts and packages I added myself for components that 
are not contained in the stock libraries.
