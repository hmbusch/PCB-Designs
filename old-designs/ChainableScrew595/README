ChainableScrew595
=================

This design features a small PCB with an 74HC595 shift register
at it's heart. Multiple modules of these can be connected together
to form a shift register cascade. The register connects to an
ULN2803A Darlington Array sink driver whose outputs are available
as a 9 port screw header (8 ports + VCC connector).
As should be obvious from the design, this module can only be used
for sink switching, as it requires fewer and more common parts than
a similar design ifor source switching.

The design was inspired by Sparkfun's Shift Register Breakout [1]
and expanded with the Darlington Array IC so that the module can
switch even higher loads (the ULN2803 can source 500mA per port)
directly. But don't forget current limiting resistors when switching
LEDs and other parts sensible to overcurrent.

For the time being, the design is untested, so use it at your own
risk only.

Gerber files
------------

This projects comes with a set of prepared gerber files for 
production. These files were generated using the Seeedstudio
Fusion PCB CAM for Eagle [2].
If you need other formats of need to make changes, feel free
to generate your own gerber files from the Eagle files.
